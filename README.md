# AutoTagger
 An music audio file tagger, uses spotify api and shazam.

## Background
I am not your average music lover, 90% of the time I am listening to music. I managed to botch a couple of speaker that were lying around in my house just so I could have some sort of sorround sound experience in my bedroom and that alone proves how much of a music junky I am. Usually I play music locally on my phone, and it bothers me to not be able to see the album art, artist name, track title and sometimes I want to sing along so I need lyrics to liven the session. I developed this application so it could automatically tag all my music files on my computer.

# Note
Still a work in progress, though I am uncertain if I am ever going to complete it because as an adult now I have less time on my hands. If you're willing to contribute please reach out.
